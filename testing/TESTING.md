###### *Bugs fixed*

- When in the plan or apparel view in the shop and trying to sort the products all product types would be called:
  - This was due to an error both in my urls file, view and the fix for it stemmed from using the templating language. Django templating was used to determine which url was currently being viewed by the user, and this would then feed back to the view. Depending on the url, the view would pick up a different value for the sort value; general, apparel or plans. This would then filter back to the view and there it would filter the results which only matched those in the sort's value, and then sort them appropriately.
- When browsing the testimonials, there was no way of the user accessing their own one if they wanted to edit / delete it:
  - This was corrected with django templating, the only way a testimonial was previously viewable was if a before and after picture was included. This was remedied by checking in the template if the current user was the author, and if this is the case then they would see and edit link appear which brings them to the testimonial in full.
- When user tries to login or register, but is already logged in on another page, they were still able to go through the whole sign in / sing up process before realising:
  - To fix this, a quick check was added to the views of these function to check if the user is already authenticated, and if this is the case then they are redirected to the home page and notified with a custom **sweetify** message for each.
  - Also when redirecting after login to the next page, these alerts were being shown at the wrong stages in the process. If the user was to be redirected to the cart they shouldn't be seeing a welcome back message, if the login was incorrect they shouldn't see a welcome back message, this was also corrected.
- When an apparel item was added to the cart, the delivery fee was added on correctly, but if it was removed and there were no apparel items in the cart the delivery fee stayed there:
  - This was an issue with where the delivery total was being added in the context file, and the conditional checking if there was an apparel item in the cart already. At first I thought the delivery total needed to be added to the for loop checking each item, but this just added it on every time. 
  - The correct way to do it to add a filter for where a product matches its id, and the category is apparel in the cart items, if this exists at all in the for loop checking all items, then the del total is 5. Then this is added to the the total value outside the for loop, and this was checked and verified to be correct when there was more than just one apparel item in the shop.
- For the all products page, and showing the average reviews for each one, there was an issue where all average reviews for all products, showed on each product:
  - This was remedied by using Django templating to check within the for loop if this rating id from the view, matched the product id, and if that was true then show the rating for this product. To make sure the id was matching the product correctly I reviewed them and gave them different ratings and checked if the average updated correctly, which it did for that product.
- In the cart when a user added the same item to the cart but with a different size it was replacing the previous item, and also duplicates were being added:
  - Firstly a check was implemented in the cart add view to see if the item was a plan, if this plan was already in the cart then it couldn't be added again, as it was merely a PDF and could just be downloaded again after purchase.
  - Secondly, a conditional was also added in the cart add and update functions where it wopuld check if the if was in the cart. If the size was already i nthe cart, then it would just add the quantity on to it. If the size was not already in the cart but the id was, then it would add a new kv pair for the quantity added and the size selected for this id. If neither were in the cat then it would just create a new item in the cart dict for this product id. If the same product had differing sizes in the cart then they would be shown as separate rows.
- When a user was logging in, there was no option to register and also if they were redirected here from the cart because they needed an account they were not redirected back to where they came from:
  - A register option was added to the login form which would redirect the user to the register page when clicked if they didn't have an account.
  - If the user was redirected to login and they had an account, then templating was used to pull the 'next' value form the url used in django apps an the user was either directed back to here if this was the case, or to he home page if not.
  - If the user was redirected to login and needed an account to proceed, then javascript was utilised to pull the previous url at the register form page, this was then sliced to the last 24 characters and if this matched the characters for a 'next' url that would trigger a hidden value on the register form. Which the view file then pulled if there and redirected the user to the cart page also, and to the home page if this was not the case.
- When browsing the site and pages of lesser content were there, the footer would be further up the page than it should be:
  - This was corrected by using css to position the footer at the bottom of the page height at all times, and a class was created which gave the containers of these pages a minimum viewport height, therefore keeping the footer at the bottom of the page as it should be.
- When testing the checkout with [stripe's](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) test numbers, and using the card declined code, an error occurred where the customer paid check was being referenced too early:
  - This led me to realise the check for cusotmer.paid was being referenced to early in the view function in the event of this error happening. The paid check and subsequent email send and was added to inside the 'try' part of the function for charging the customer in stripe, else telling them their card was declined with a **sweetify** alert.
- When trying to edit a testimonial on the page, the previously written content was not being pulled and the form was blank:
  - This led to a lot of troubleshooting and failed attempts at fixing the issue, even trying the make a new edit view function purely for editing the previous form. Eventually I realised that the regex in the testimonials urls file was incorrect, and therefore was not routing correctly to pull the previous testimonial, this was altered and it is working correctly now.
- Wheel entering the credit card details at the checkout, there were no form errors being shown clearly to the user.
  - The first issue was that there were no validations added to the credit card form's fields used in the forms file, these were added and the notifications were shown to the user.
  - Secondly an alert div was added which made use of [BS4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)'s alert-danger class to highlight the area in red and make the card error clear to the user.
- While testing registering on a phone, it became clear a user could not do this as they couldn't added the photo required for the profile picture field:
  - The field on the forms file was given 'required=False' attribute to firstly stop errors coming up and preventing the user from registering because the picture was missing. Then a default profile picture was added to the account in the view if this field was left empty by the user on sign up.

  ###### *Bugs still an issue*

There was an bug in IE where the JQuery used doesn't work, I looked up [Can i use](https://caniuse.com/#search=jquery) and unfortunately it isn't available in any forms of IE.

#### Automated Testing

##### Validation

- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate HTML.
- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS.
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript.

No major errors were observed, the only one to note was with CSS and this relates to a known BS problem.

##### Jasmine

The main functions were tested in this project with Jasmine as a means of ensuring they were working as planned. The way I approached the testing method was to start small and make sure it is implemented correctly in the first place and work from there. The files for testing are below:

- [Jasmine HTML](https://github.com/brianscan14/XYfitness/blob/master/testing/jasmine/jasmine.html)
- [Jasmine JS specs](https://github.com/brianscan14/XYfitness/blob/master/testing/jasmine/jasmine.spec.js)
- [JS](https://github.com/brianscan14/XYfitness/blob/master/static/js/script.js)

###### Running the tests

Firstly make sure the the project is cloned from the GitHub repo and running on your own IDE as outlined in the [README.md](https://github.com/brianscan14/Gourmet_Grub/blob/master/README.md) file. Then:

1. Open the Jasmine HTML file.
2. Run it to see the results in your browser.

To create Jasmine tests of your own:

1. Open the Jasmine spec file.
2. Write the tests using Jasmine's framework.
3. Save the spec and refresh the HTML file.

**Travis**

Throughout the course of the project [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) was used as a means of keeping continuous integration with the Heroku site. If the build was not successful at any stage then there was an issue with the code and this was remedied to ensure the site was deployed successfully.
